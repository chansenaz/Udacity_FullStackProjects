### About
This is the first project for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

### Features
This webpage displays a tileset of some of my favorite movies. Click on a movie to view its trailer!

### How to Use
Open fresh_tomatoes.html in your favorite browser!
If you would like to add more movies to Fresh Tomatoes, open data/moviedata.csv and add a new row for each movie, save & close and then run fresh_tomatoes.py to generate a new fresh_tomatoes.html.
